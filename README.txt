Our parser accepts sentences of the following types:

A borders B to the South.
A lies to the South of B.
A is located South of B.

The directional information is a leftover from when it was necessary for the assignment.
The parser also parses sentences of the type "A is smaller than B.", but this type of
information is not incorporated into the graph.
